# EzCScreenCap

A simple desktop capture program written in Windows C++

I have no plans to update this, I wrote it in 30 minutes.

Compile args are in the Makefile

### Program args

```
./capture [bmp|jpeg|gif|tiff|png (or whatever else your OS supports)]

Encoder type defaults to bmp
```

# Changelog
